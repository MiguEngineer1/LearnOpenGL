# Learn OpenGL Book

In this repository I will host the code I write as I follow through with the tutorials and chapters of the
[LearnOpenGL](https://www.learnopengl.com) book.

There will be 4 branches (at least for now).

* ``main``: Will remain empty, with only a basic ``Hello World`` for now.
* ``sample``: The samples provided by the book. After each milestone in the book (creating a window, drawing a 
triangle, etc.) the author shows us a sample code. This is important for comparison.
* ``follow``: The code I write as I advance through the chapters by reading. May be different from the actual code
writen by the author, may not be as well organized or as efficient.
* ``creative``: After each chapter, I will take the code I wrote and find ways to refactor it, make it "cleaner"
or overall just find ways to change it. The idea is for me to have to re-read the code, think through it, and in
doing so reinforce the topics learned. This branch will eventually be merged with the ``main`` branch.

**NOTE: I am really bad at naming things, don't judge me**
